<h2>Well Hello there!</h2>

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on Github.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. 
Forks act as a sort of bridge.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/breakthru2/trymee.git) as practice.
